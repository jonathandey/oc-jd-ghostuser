## OctoberCMS User Ghosting
This is an [OctoberCMS](https://octobercms.com) plugin that will allow adimistrators to login to any RainLab.User (front-end) account.
This plugin will come in useful when you need to login to that user account that is having 'issues'. The plugin requires the [RainLab.User plugin](https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-user) and unless your admin account is a Super User you will need to have the required permissions set to use it. These permissions can be set in the Backend Settings.

#### How do I know if I'm Ghosting?
The plugin comes with a [ghostBanner] component. Add this component to your websites layout (or any other particular page) and a Ghosting Banner will be shown at the top of your website. Clicking this banner will log you out of the ghosting session and redirect you back to the backend user list.
